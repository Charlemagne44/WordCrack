# Word Crack

This is a quick, simple (and messy) tool to find letters contained in the websters English dictionary within a 4x4 grid. Primarily created for the game pigeon game "word hunt". Parameters can be altered for a larger grid in other circumstances.

The user simply enters all 16 characters in top to bottom succession,  a  rough outline of each of the best paths is then printed out to the user for  each starting character. Utilizes bruteforce backtracking and refernces  the Websters English Dictionary that was slotted  into a home brewed  Trie data structure for  quicker access. Lots of the words generated are English, but aren't recognized by Word Hunt. You may also configure a different json dictionary if there is a better alternative.
